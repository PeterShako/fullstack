Git (/ɡɪt/ ⓘ[8]) is a distributed version control software system[9] that is capable of managing versions of source code or data. It is often used to control source code by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.

Design goals of Git include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows—thousands of parallel branches running on different computers.[10][11][12]

As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire repository, also known as the "repo", with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. A repository is stored on each computer in a standard directory with additional, hidden files to provide version control capabilities.[13] Git provides features to synchronize changes between repositories that share history; for asynchronous collaboration, this extends to repositories on remote machines. Although all repositories (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repository to hold an integrated copy.

Git is free and open-source software shared under the GPL-2.0-only license.

Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds for version control in the development of the Linux kernel.[14] The trademark "Git" is registered by the Software Freedom Conservancy.

Today, Git is the version control system most commonly used by software developers. It is the most popular distributed version control system,[15][16] with nearly 95% of developers reporting it as their primary version control system as of 2022.[17] It is the most widely used source-code management tool among professional developers. There are offerings of Git repository services, including GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket and GitLab.[18][19][20][21][22]

History
Torvalds started developing Git in April 2005 after the free license for BitKeeper, the proprietary source-control management (SCM) system used for Linux kernel development since 2002, was revoked for Linux.[23][24] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, claimed that Andrew Tridgell had created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the BitKeeper protocols.[25] The same incident also spurred the creation of Mercurial, another version-control system.

Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs. He cited an example of a source-control management system needing 30 seconds to apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where synchronizing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at once. For his design criterion, he specified that patching should take no more than three seconds, and added three more goals:[10]

Take the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision.[12]
Support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow.[12]
Include very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious.[11]
These criteria eliminated every version-control system in use at the time, so immediately after the 2.6.12-rc2 Linux kernel development release, Torvalds set out to write his own.[12]

The development of Git began on 3 April 2005.[26] Torvalds announced the project on 6 April and became self-hosting the next day.[26][27] The first merge of multiple branches took place on 18 April.[28] Torvalds achieved his performance goals; on 29 April, the nascent Git was benchmarked recording patches to the Linux kernel tree at a rate of 6.7 patches per second.[29] On 16 June, Git managed the kernel 2.6.12 release.[30]

Torvalds turned over maintenance on 26 July 2005 to Junio Hamano, a major contributor to the project.[31] Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21 December 2005.[32]

Naming
Torvalds quipped about the name git (which is British English slang for an unpleasant or silly person): "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."[33][34] The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".[35]

The read-me file of the source code elaborates further:[36]

"git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.

Random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
Stupid. Contemptible and despicable. Simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
"Global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
"Goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks.
The source code for Git refers to the program as "the information manager from hell".[37][38]

Characteristics
Design
Git's design is a synthesis of Torvalds's experience with Linux in maintaining a large distributed development project, along with his intimate knowledge of file-system performance gained from the same project and the urgent need to produce a working system in short order. These influences led to the following implementation choices:[14]

Strong support for non-linear development
Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history. In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit.
Distributed development
Like Darcs, BitKeeper, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Monotone, Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.[39]
Compatibility with existing systems and protocols
Repositories can be published via Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket or Secure Shell (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of existing CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. Subversion repositories can be used directly with git-svn.[40]
Efficient handling of large projects
Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,[41] and performance tests done by Mozilla[42] showed that it was an order of magnitude faster diffing large repositories than Mercurial and GNU Bazaar; fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.[43]
Cryptographic authentication of history
The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a commit in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed. The structure is similar to a Merkle tree, but with added data at the nodes and leaves.[44] (Mercurial and Monotone also have this property.)
Toolkit-based design
Git was designed as a set of programs written in C and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.[45] Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.[46]
Pluggable merge strategies
As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.[47]
Garbage accumulates until collected
Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform garbage collection when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using git gc.[48][49]
Periodic explicit object packing
Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes up a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of packs that store a large number of objects delta-compressed among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a packfile. Packs are compressed using the heuristic that files with the same name are probably similar, without depending on this for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, recording the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects, and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a workday. Git does periodic repacking automatically, but manual repacking is also possible with the git gc command.[50] For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an SHA-1 checksum[51] inside, and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the git fsck command.[52][53]
